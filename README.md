# Simple Compiler for Education

📌 Overview
--------

This repository contains my Bachelor’s Thesis (TFG) project, focused on the design and implementation of a compiler.
The project explores the main stages of compilation, from source code processing to code generation, with an emphasis on software architecture, correctness, and system-level reasoning.

The goal of this project was to apply theoretical computer science concepts in a practical and structured software engineering context, building a working simple compiler pipeline that students can use to understand the compilation stages.

🧠 Project Objectives
--------

- Design and implement a complete compilation pipeline

- Apply formal language and compiler theory to real code

- Build modular and maintainable components

⚙️ Compiler Structure
--------

The project is organized around the classical compiler phases:

- Lexical Analysis – tokenization of source code

- Syntax Analysis – parsing and grammar validation

- Semantic Analysis – symbol management and semantic checks

- Intermediate Representation – structured internal model

- Code Generation – target code emission

Each phase is implemented as a clearly separated module, enabling easier reasoning, testing, and extension.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
--------

- Programming Languages: C 

- Bottom-up Parsing

- Concrete Syntax Trees (CST)

- Modular software architecture


🚀 How to Run
--------

```bash
gcc main.c -o my_program
./my_program


# 📌 Future Improvements

Optimization passes

Extended language features

Improved error handling

Additional target architectures
