# Simple Compiler for Education

**** 📌 OVERVIEW ****

. This repository contains my Bachelor’s Thesis (TFG) project, focused on the design and implementation of a compiler.
. The project explores the main stages of compilation, from source code processing to code generation, emphasizing software architecture, correctness, and system-level reasoning.
. The goal of this project was to apply theoretical computer science concepts in a practical and structured software engineering context, building a simple compiler pipeline that students can use to understand compilation stages.

**** 🧠 PROJECT OBJECTIVES ****

. Design and implement a complete compilation pipeline
. Apply formal language and compiler theory to real code
. Build modular and maintainable components

**** ⚙️ COMPILER STRUCTURE ****

. Lexical Analysis – tokenization of source code
. Syntax Analysis – parsing and grammar validation
. Semantic Analysis – symbol management and semantic checks
. Intermediate Representation – structured internal model
. Code Generation – target code emission

. Each phase is implemented as a separated module, enabling easier reasoning, testing, and extension.

**** 🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS ****

. Programming Language: C
. Bottom-up Parsing
. Concrete Syntax Trees (CST)
. Modular Software Architecture

**** 🚀 HOW TO RUN ****

. Compile the project:
gcc main.c -o my_program
. Run the program:
./my_program

**** 📌 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS ****

. Optimization passes
. Extended language features
. Improved error handling
. Additional target architectures
