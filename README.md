# Simple Compiler for Education

📌 OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
• This repository contains my Bachelor’s Thesis (TFG) project,
  focused on the design and implementation of a compiler.
• The project explores the main stages of compilation, from
  source code processing to code generation, emphasizing
  software architecture, correctness, and system-level reasoning.
• The goal was to apply theoretical computer science concepts
  in a practical and structured software engineering context,
  building a simple compiler pipeline that students can use
  to understand compilation stages.

🧠 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------
• Design and implement a complete compilation pipeline
• Apply formal language and compiler theory to real code
• Build modular and maintainable components

⚙️ COMPILER STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------
• Lexical Analysis        – tokenization of source code
• Syntax Analysis         – parsing and grammar validation
• Semantic Analysis       – symbol management and semantic checks
• Intermediate Representation – structured internal model
• Code Generation         – target code emission

• Each phase is implemented as a separated module, enabling
  easier reasoning, testing, and extension.

🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS
------------------------------------------------------------
• Programming Language: C
• Bottom-up Parsing
• Concrete Syntax Trees (CST)
• Modular Software Architecture

🚀 HOW TO RUN
------------------------------------------------------------
• Compile the project:
    gcc main.c -o my_program
• Run the program:
    ./my_program

📌 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
• Optimization passes
• Extended language features
• Improved error handling
• Additional target architectures
